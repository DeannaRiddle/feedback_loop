# Feedback Loop

Within this project we had to recreate our Prime Daily Feedback form. Although each question had to be on their own page with a review page. The review page had to compile all the information that was entered in the previous pages.

## Description

We had to re-create our Prime daily feedback forms spread over multiple pages.
The landing page is the first question.
You must answer and click through to the next. Until you reach the review page.
You can not change your answers or go back. You can only submit your answers at the end.
